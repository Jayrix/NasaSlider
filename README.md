# NasaSlider

A simple slider based on React using NASA API for A Picture of the Day presentation, but in reality 
for playing around with fetch() and its relations with React component life cycles.

I am not storing downloaded image files on purpose for learning purposes (maximizing fetch()
and overall asynchronicity without breaking the app).

Still got to fix 1st img loading two times and make some nicer css for better overall UX
(starting with another preloader as this one takes too long to start animating).
