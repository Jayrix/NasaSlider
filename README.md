# NasaSlider

A simple slider based on React using NASA API for A Picture of the Day presentation, but in reality 
for playing around with fetch() and its relations with React component life cycles.

Still got to fix 1st img loading two times and make some nicer css for better overall experience
(starting with another preloader).
